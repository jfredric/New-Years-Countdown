# New-Years-Countdown

## 11 Health - Mobile Developer - Coding Challenge

Please create an app that will have a text input field for a zip code and display the relevant time zone information for that zip code.

Once the time zone information is entered, a timer should appear, with a countdown to midnight on New Year’s Eve at the locale entered.

The time zone information should be retrieved from a local REST service below using an API key in the headers as follows:

* http://localhost:5000/api/timezone/{zipcode}

* headers[“X-Application-Key”] = “b064b6d2-8fbd-48b0-ac29-1a88237ce022”

Make sure to follow the instructions in the README.md file on how to set up and run the REST service on your local machine.

When you have completed this challenge, please push your project to a GitHub repository so we can review your code.

Good luck!
